👋 Hi, I’m Megnath Ramesh (@megalphian)! I'm a graduate researcher in robotics and my goal is to make intelligent robots that react to changes in unknown environments.

👀 I’m interested in **path planning algorithms**, computational geometry, and machine learning (Neural networks and RL).

🌱 I’m currently learning **coverage planning** algorithms, more specifically generating plans that enable fast coverage of uncertain environments.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that aim to build **robots for the future of food**.

📫 You can reach me at **megnath.ramesh@gmail.com**
